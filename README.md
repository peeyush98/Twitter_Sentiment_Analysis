Can deep learning 'steal' the logic of rules-based sentiment analysis packages? In this project, we will see if a deep learning model can replicate the scores of a well-known sentiment analysis scoring model called 'Sentiment Intensity Analyzer' from the nltk package.

For this project, we will scrape 1000 tweets from any person(s) or organization(s) we are interested in. These tweets will be fed into the nltk SentimentIntensityAnalyzer() and generate four sentiment scores: positive, negative, neutral and composite. We will then use these scores as your target variables (a neural network with 4 outputs) and try to predict them by just using the words in the Tweets!
