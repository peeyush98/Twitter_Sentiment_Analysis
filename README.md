This is the final project of my Deep Learning class. Me and my team scraped tweets from multiple accounts and then feed these Tweets into the nltk SentimentIntensityAnalyzer() and generated four sentiment scores: positive, negative, neutral and composite. We then used these scores as our target variables (a neural network with 4 outputs) and predicted them by just using the words in the Tweets!
